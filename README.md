# UFOs

## Overview of Project
In this project we support dana, who with our help designed a site on which news about UFO sightings will be compiled. Using JavaScript we will extract the information and convert it into tables, in the same way with Bootstrap and Css we will format the page.
## Results
On the web page there is a small summary about the research that made it possible to carry out the page. Below this introduction we find a search engine with UFO abyss filters, we can filter by date, city, state, country and form.
